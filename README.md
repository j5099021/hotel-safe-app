# hotel-safe-app
Hotel safe application using React and Redux. 

You can check the solution starting from src/App.js. Src/App - React.js is my solution using just React, src/App – Redux.js is the one with redux, try to copy either one of those file to the src/App.js to try each solution.

# What does it do?
The hotel safe has a key pad that you can press to enter up to 4 numbers at a time.
Users should be able to store a 4 digit PIN code and indicate via the LockIndicator that the safe is locked.
Trying to set a PIN number that is not 4 digits (set by clicking the enter key '⇨') will display an 'INAVLID' error message.
Once Locked users should be able to key in the stored 4 digit PIN click enter and the safe will unlocked.
Invalid PIN numbers show should the message 'INVALID' on the LCDScreen.

# How to install and run the application
run 'npm install' before running 'npm start'
